# content-humane

I am developing an innovative AI content humanizer app . This app is designed to revolutionize content creation  for research papers by bypassing leading plagiarism detection tools such as Originality.ai, ZeroGPT, Content at Scale, Winston AI, Copyleaks, Turnitin, and GPTZero. It will enable users to humanize text without any word count restrictions and maintaining formal tone ensuring that the output is both unique and undetectable by these tools. With its advanced algorithms, the app will enhance the readability and originality of the content, setting a new standard in content generation

## Collaborate with GPT Engineer

This is a [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)-synced repository ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed to this repo.

If you clone this repo and push changes, you will have them reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GPT-Engineer-App/content-humane.git
cd content-humane
npm i
```

```

This will run a dev server with auto reloading and an instant preview.
